## Authentication with JWT in Node.js REST APIs

**Summary:** This article guides you through securing Node.js REST APIs with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It covers:

- **Setting up an Express.js app:** Create a basic Express app for your API.
- **User registration:** Implement user registration with email and password.
- **JWT token generation:** Upon successful login, generate and return JWT access tokens.
- **Understanding access & refresh tokens:** Explore the two-token model (access & refresh) for extended access and secure token refresh.
- **API protection with JWT:** Secure your API endpoints by requiring a valid JWT token for access.
- **Retire refresh tokens:** Implement mechanisms to invalidate and manage refresh token lifespans.

**Key takeaways:**

- JWTs provide a secure and stateless way to authenticate users in Node.js APIs.
- Access and refresh tokens offer enhanced security and extended access control.
- Understanding and implementing token management practices is crucial for robust API security.

**Target audience:** Node.js developers seeking to secure their REST APIs with JWT authentication.

**Resources:** The article includes code snippets and links to relevant libraries and documentation.
